# Rational Krylov methods for Stielthes functions
This repository contains the code used for performing the numerical 
experiments in [1]; the experiments are included in the following M-files:

- <code>experiment_cauchy_1D.m</code>
 - <code>experiment_cauchy_2D.m</code>
 - <code>experiment_laplace_1D.m</code> 
 - <code>experiment_laplace_2D.m</code>

Note: [rktoolbox](http://rktoolbox.org) is required to run the experiments.
Please download it and add it to the path before proceeding.
